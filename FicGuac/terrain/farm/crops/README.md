# Crops
Each one of the crops for the farm is it's own scene. This allows us to emulate quirks, oddities, and behaviors of the crops.

## Barley
A pretty basic wheat-like crop. Exhibits a "crushing" / "trampling" / "folding" behavior, where a *Pawn* passing over the barley will cause it to fold over.

## Cabbage
A cabbage, or something sort of approximating what a cabbage might possibly look like.

## Carrot
A carrot. Most of the carrot is purposefully underground.

## Corn
A stalk of corn. I swear. Exhibits a "crushing" / "trampling" / "folding" behavior, where a *Pawn* passing over the corn will cause it to fold over.

## StrongBarley
Basically a duplicate of the *Barley*, save that it doesn't get crushed (i.e. it exhibits no unusual behaviors).

## Sunflower
A sunflower. Exhibits a "crushing" / "trampling" / "folding" behavior, where a *Pawn* passing over the sunflower will cause it to fold over.
