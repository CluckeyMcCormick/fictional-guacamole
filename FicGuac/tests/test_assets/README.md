# Tests Assets
This is a directory for scenes and assets that are used in testing - exclusively for testing. Anything used sporadically or in level construction/prototyping should go in the *utility* directory.

## Cubit
The *Cubit* is both a test vehicle for the *KinematicDriver* and a demonstration of the minimal effort required to integrate the drive and order it's parent/target node around.
