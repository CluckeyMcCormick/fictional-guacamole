To Do:

1. Build and Change a NavigationMesh on the fly

    This is the big one - a problem with Godot that I've seen at least one blog
    post complaining about is that there is no immediate and obvious way to
    create NavigationMeshes on the fly.

    However, since I want my prototype to have a dynamic world where trees
    fall over and block paths, or the player can put down more structures, or
    UnitPawns slow down when moving through certain areas. It is imperative,
    then, that I be able to edit and create a NavigationMesh at will.

    The answer is actually avaiable right now - the "Godot Navigation Lite"
    addon by Miloš Lukić. Looking at it, it has pretty much everything we need,
    we just need to play with it a little bit more.

    To stress test our little wandering Pawn, we should also add the ability to
    place down things like rocks, trees, or houses. And maybe, with a little
    bit of fiddling, we can get multiple meshes that recognize danger and the
    like...
