To Do:
------
1. Upgrade to Godot 4.0 (whenever that happens)

    We're currently using some features supplied via addon (i.e. Miloš Lukić's 
    Godot Navigation Lite) that are supported in the base version of Godot 4.0.
    We should upgrade to 4.0 as soon as possible. It's just a question of
    whenever that comes out...

2. Revise our existing structures
    
    We currently have two variants on a basic house - the House, and the Hut. We
    should really only have one. In addition, I want to change some of the
    textures around, SPECIFICALLY so that the Sims-style wall cutaways look
    better. I left those untextured out of laziness. Also, we should add an
    option to generate a bottom mesh on the wall - this will prevent light from
    shining inappropriately

3. Add a testing root menu

    We very frequently swap out our "active" test depending on what we're
    testing. Rather than constantly updating what our "current" test is through
    the project settings, we should have a scene that's just a menu. Each option
    on the menu is a different test. You should be able to pick any test scene
    and load it, then exit in real time.
    
    This will be a good test for us - loading scenes, doing menus, pausing the
    game. Maybe doing a loading screen of some sort...

4. Create weapon models

    We need to create weapons for our pawns to equip! We'll use OpenSCAD to
    design the models. Technically, since we use sprites in-game, we could just
    use models off the internet. However, I want the weapons designed to fit the
    Pawn models - and to be open source.
    
    We'll need:
    - A crossbow
    - A bow
    - A gun (musket-eque)
    - A sword
    - A halberd/pike
    - A shield
    - A torch
    - A knife
    
    And maybe a jezzail - a long rifle of some sort?

5. Integrate the weapon models and the Pawn sprites

    Okay, so we have to integrate our weapon models and our Pawn sprites.
    Conventional wisdom says that we should just have different spritesheets for
    each weapon. While we'll PROBABLY do that, I wanted to see if we can do
    anything extra kooky. Like, maybe we could have animation sets that are just
    the weapon and could somehow be layered over the Pawn Sprite? That would
    save us on Sprites.

6. ATTACKS!
    
    Finally, get our pawns to attack with their weapons. For now, we'll use some
    really basic target. The AI knowing how, and when, to attack will be the
    next big step for the project.
