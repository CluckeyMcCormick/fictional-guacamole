# Colors

This game uses the Resurrect64 palette by
[Kerrie Lake](https://kerrielakeportfolio.wordpress.com/).
I retrieved the palette from
[Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-64).

I had to extend the palette just for the buildings - I wanted the wood and
stones to be a bit darker. You can see my extensions under the main palette in
`resurrect64_extended.png`. I don't think I did that great, and I'm sure an
actual artist could select colors that got the job done better, BUT they work
for what I need (which is all I really need).

These colors have been included for reference AND for use with the ImageMagick
Posterize-Ditherize script. That script takes in an file that contains all the
colors we can map to. The "chits" are provided as convenient inputs for that
script.
